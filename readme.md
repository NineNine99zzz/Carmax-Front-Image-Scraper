# Carmax Image Scraper

This repository provides a set of Python scripts to automate the scraping of car images from the CarMax website. Using tools like Selenium and BeautifulSoup, this project navigates through pages, retrieves car details, and downloads images into a specified local directory.

### Features

- **Automated Image Scraping**: Navigates CarMax's 'All Cars' section and captures images of various car models.
- **Dynamic User-Agent Rotation**: Mimics browser requests with changing user agents to avoid detection.
- **Error Handling & Retrying**: Implements robust error handling to ensure stability during scraping.

### Requirements

1. **Python 3.12.3**
2. **Libraries**:
   - `requests`
   - `BeautifulSoup4`
   - `Selenium`

   - `fake_useragent`

Install all requirements with:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Usage

1. **Configure**: Update any relevant paths or settings in `get_car_image.py`.
2. **Run the Scripts**:
    - **Scrape Car Images**: Run `get_car_image.py` to scrape car images and save the HTML content of the CarMax webpage.
    - **Fetch Image URLs**: Use `get_image_url.ipynb` to retrieve URLs of car details and save them to a CSV file.
    - **Download Images**: Run `main.py` to start the download process and save images to the `images` directory.
